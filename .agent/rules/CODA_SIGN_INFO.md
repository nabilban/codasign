CodaSign Project Definition & Features

1. General Project Information
   Project Name: CodaSign

Core Purpose: A streamlined mobile application designed for managing digital signatures and signing PDF documents securely and efficiently.

Target Audience: Professionals, freelancers, and businesses needing a quick way to sign contracts, NDAs, and service agreements on the go.

Design Language: Modern, dark-themed UI (Navy/Midnight Blue background) with glowing cyan/neon blue accents for primary actions. The interface focuses on high contrast and clear typography.

2. Core Feature Set
   Signature Management:

Create Signature: A dedicated canvas for users to draw signatures using a finger or stylus.

Signature Library: Users can save multiple signatures (e.g., "aaa" created on Feb 18, 2026) and manage them (View/Delete).

Document Workflow:

Document Import: Ability to upload or select PDF documents for signing (e.g., Contract Agreement.pdf, NDA Document.pdf).

Document Preview: A detailed view showing file name, page count, and file size before signing.

Sign Here Indicators: Visual placeholders within the PDF indicating exactly where a signature is required.

Status Tracking:

Dashboard: High-level overview showing "Total Signed" documents and "Total Pages" processed.

Document History: A list of "Signed PDFs" with status labels (e.g., "Completed"), timestamps, and the name of the signer (e.g., John Doe, Jane Smith).

Post-Signing Actions:

Integrated options to View, Share, and Download completed documents directly from the app.

3. UI/UX Rules & Logic
   Interaction Flow:

From the Home Screen, users choose between "Create Signature" or "Sign Document."

When signing a document, the user must select a saved signature from a bottom-sheet modal or create a new one on the fly.

Visual Feedback:

Primary action buttons (like "Sign Document" or "Sign Here") should use a gradient glow effect.

Empty states (e.g., "No signatures yet") should provide a clear call to action to guide the user.

Would you like me to generate a specific README file based on these features, or perhaps help you draft the technical documentation for the Flutter implementation?
